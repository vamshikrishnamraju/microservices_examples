 There are a many more WorkItemHandler implementations present in the jbpm-workitems module. If you're looking for specific integration logic 
 with Twitter, for example, we recommend you take a look at the classes made available there.

In general, a WorkItemHandler's .executeWorkItem(...) and .abortWorkItem(...) methods will do the following:

    Extract information about the task being executed (or aborted) from the WorkItem instance
    Execute the necessary business logic. This might be mean interacting with a web service, database, or other technical component.
    Inform the process engine that the work item has been completed (or aborted) by calling one of the following two mtehods on 
    the WorkItemManager instance passed to the method: 

WorkItemManager.completeWorkItem(long workItemId, Map<String, Object> results)

WorkItemManager.abortWorkItem(long workItemId)
