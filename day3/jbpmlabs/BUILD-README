To build a ~/.m2/repository to capture:
0.  Temporarily uncomment the 2 techpreview profiles in ~/.m2/settings.xml and make sure your workstation can get to the Internet
1.  start BPMS server:  cd $JBOSS_HOME/bin; ./standalone.sh
2.  cd ~/JB427/support/solutions; mvn clean install -fae (fail at end)
3.  cd ~/JB427/support/solutions/integrate-cdi ; mvn jboss-as:deploy (should deploy)
4.  cd ~/JB427/support/solutions/integrate-api; mvn exec:java 
5.  cd ~/JB427/support/solutions/integrate-bc-remote; mvn clean package 
6.  open JBDS, import integrate-cdi and let it build fully
7.  cd ~/.m2; zip -r maven-class-repository-427.zip repository
8.  generate the RPM and replace the one on elvis

The best way to capture the repository is after doing all the labs but this should get all plugins and dependencies needed by the labs.
