When a boundary Compensation event is added (or processed in an existing BPMN2 file), the waitforCompletion attribute seems to be added automatically, with the value of false.

Given that this attribute indicates support for asynchronous compensation (which we do not yet have), I think it would be better to

    Not add the attribute at all, unless the user chooses asynchronous compensation (e.g. for waitForCompletion=false)

Otherwise, adding the attribute by default with a value of true would also be fine. 



isForCompensation="true"

Any task for compensation purpose need the above attribute to be set
