jhat (com.sun.tools.hat.Main)
Once you've dumped the heap into a binary file, you can use jhat to analyze 
the binary heap dump file. jhat creates an HTTP/HTML server that can be surfed 
in a browser, giving an object-by-object view of the heap, frozen in time. 

example:

>jhat heapDump.jmap

By default, it will start http server on port 7000.
Then we will go to http://localhost:7000/
