The jcmd Utility

The jcmd utility is used to send diagnostic command requests to the JVM, where
these requests are useful for controlling Java Flight Recordings, troubleshoot, 
and diagnose JVM and Java Applications. 

It must be used on the same machine where the JVM is running, 


example :


> jcmd
5485 sun.tools.jcmd.JCmd
2125 MyProgram
 
> jcmd MyProgram help (or "jcmd 2125 help")
2125:
The following commands are available:
JFR.stop
JFR.start
JFR.dump
JFR.check
VM.native_memory
VM.check_commercial_features
VM.unlock_commercial_features
ManagementAgent.stop
ManagementAgent.start_local
ManagementAgent.start
Thread.print
GC.class_stats
GC.class_histogram
GC.heap_dump
GC.run_finalization
GC.run
VM.uptime
VM.flags
VM.system_properties
VM.command_line
VM.version
help
 
> jcmd MyProgram help Thread.print
2125:
Thread.print
Print all threads with stacktraces.




Troubleshoot with jcmd Utility
------------------------------

The jcmd utility provides the following troubleshooting options:

    Start a recording

    For example, to start a 2-minute recording on the running Java process with the identifier 7060 and save it to myrecording.jfr in the current directory, use the following:

    jcmd 7060 JFR.start name=MyRecording settings=profile delay=20s duration=2m filename=C:\TEMP\myrecording.jfr

    Check a recording

    The JFR.check diagnostic command checks a running recording. For example:

    jcmd 7060 JFR.check

    Stop a recording

    The JFR.stop diagnostic command stops a running recording and has the option to discard the recording data. For example:

    jcmd 7060 JFR.stop

    Dump a recording

    The JFR.dump diagnostic command stops a running recording and has the option to dump recordings to a file. For example:

    jcmd 7060 JFR.dump name=MyRecording filename=C:\TEMP\myrecording.jfr

Monitoring .jfr file
