jmap (sun.tools.jmap) -> Memory Map

Sometimes, the problem you're dealing with is an object leak, such as an 
ArrayList (which could hold thousands of objects) that just isn't getting 
released when it should. Another problem that is more general would be 
an expanding heap that never seems to shrink, despite active garbage collection.


Ex :

jmap -dump:file=heapDump.jmap <process-id>
