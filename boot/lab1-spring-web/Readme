Uses Of Annotation-Config, Annotation-Driven And Component-Scan
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. annotation-config allow us to use @Autowire, @Required and @Qualifier annotations.
2. component-scan allow @Component, @Service, @Controller, etc.. annotations.
3. annotation-driven <mvc:annotation-driven /> declares explicit support for annotation-driven MVC controllers
 (i.e. @RequestMapping, @Controller, although support for those is the default behaviour), 
 as well as adding support for declrative validation via @Valid and message body marshalling with
  @RequestBody/ResponseBody.
  

Note : @EnableWebMvc is equivalent to <mvc:annotation-driven /> in XML
